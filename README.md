## **Project Description -** 

With the help of this dynamic and interactive Road Safety Dashboard, discover the hidden trends underlying traffic incidents. This research provides critical insights into casualty patterns, accident severity, vehicle involvement, and road conditions by visualizing over 3 million data points from 2021 and 2022. The dashboard, which is intended for use by safety experts and transport authorities, assists stakeholders in making data-driven decisions that will lower accident rates and enhance roadside public safety. Enhance your knowledge of traffic safety with concise, useful ideas.

## **Key Insights -** 

✤ Primary KPIs:

Total number of casualties. <br>
Breakdown of casualties based on severity (fatal, serious, slight). <br>
Casualties by vehicle type (cars, buses, trucks, bicycles). <br>
Monthly comparison of casualties between current year (CY) and previous year (PY). <br>

✤ Secondary KPIs:

Casualties by road type (single/dual carriageways, roundabouts, one-way streets). <br>
Distribution by road surface conditions (dry, wet, icy). <br>
Casualties by time of day (daylight, dark). <br>
Urban vs Rural casualty breakdown. <br>

## **Stakeholders -** 

The following stakeholders, who want insights to improve road safety, are the target audience for the dashboard:
* Ministry of Transport
* Road Transport Department
* Police Force
* Emergency Services
* Road Safety Corps
* Transport Operators
* Traffic Management Agencies
* Public & Media

## **Tools Used -** 

Data Processing & Visualization Tool: Microsoft Excel

✤ Techniques: <br>
